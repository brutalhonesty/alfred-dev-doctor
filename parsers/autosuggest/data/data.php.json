The database is created in BTree mode, other modes (like Hash or Queue)        are not supported.                      Additionally you can set the database lock method with the next char.         Use l to lock the database with a .lck        file or d to lock the databasefile itself. It is         important that all of your applications do this consistently.                      If you want to test the access and do not want to wait for the lock         you can add t as third character. When you are         absolutely sure that you do not require database locking you can do         so by using - instead of l or        d. When none of d,         l or - is used, dba will lock        on the database file as it would with d.              Note:                  There can only be one writer for one database file. When you use dba on          a web server and more than one request requires write operations they can         only be done one after another. Also read during write is not allowed.         The dba extension uses locks to prevent this. See the following table:                   DBA locking                                              already open             mode = \"rl\"             mode = \"rlt\"             mode = \"wl\"             mode = \"wlt\"             mode = \"rd\"             mode = \"rdt\"             mode = \"wd\"             mode = \"wdt\"                                                             not open             ok             ok             ok             ok             ok             ok             ok             ok                                      mode = \"rl\"             ok             ok             wait             false             illegal             illegal             illegal             illegal                                      mode = \"wl\"             wait             false             wait             false             illegal             illegal             illegal             illegal                                      mode = \"rd\"             illegal             illegal             illegal             illegal             ok             ok             wait             false                                      mode = \"wd\"             illegal             illegal             illegal             illegal             wait             false             wait             false                                                               ok: the second call will be successfull.          wait: the second call waits until dba_close() is called for the first.          false: the second call returns false.          illegal: you must not mix \"l\" and \"d\" modifiers for mode parameter.                                                 handler                      The name of the handler which        shall be used for accessing path.

Changelog                                 Version        Description                                    4.3.0                 It&#039;s possible to open database files over network connection. However         in cases a socket connection will be used (as with http or ftp) the         connection will be locked instead of the resource itself. This is important          to know since in such cases locking is simply ignored on the resource          and other solutions have to be found.                               4.3.0                 Locking and the mode modifiers \"l\", \"d\", \"-\"         and \"t\" were added.         In previous PHP versions, you must use semaphores to guard against         simultaneous database access for any database handler with the exception          of GDBM. See System V semaphore support.                               before 4.3.5                 open mode &#039;c&#039; is broken for several internal handlers and truncates         the database instead of appending data to an existent database.          Also dbm and ndbm fail on mode &#039;c&#039; in typical configurations (this          cannot be fixed).

So it is    equivalent to reading an entry from the directory.            Parameters                    link_identifier                      An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().                                base_dn                      The base DN for the directory.                                filter                      An empty filter is not allowed. If you want to retrieve absolutely all        information for this entry, use a filter of         objectClass=*. If you know which entry types are        used on the directory server, you might use an appropriate filter such        as objectClass=inetOrgPerson.                                attributes                      An array of the required attributes, e.g. array(\"mail\", \"sn\", \"cn\").        Note that the \"dn\" is always returned irrespective of which attributes        types are requested.                      Using this parameter is much more efficient than the default action        (which is to return all attributes and their associated values).         The use of this parameter should therefore be considered good        practice.                                attrsonly                      Should be set to 1 if only attribute types are wanted. If set to 0        both attributes types and attribute values are fetched which is the        default behaviour.                                sizelimit                      Enables you to limit the count of entries fetched. Setting this to 0        means no limit.              Note:                  This parameter can NOT override server-side preset sizelimit. You can         set it lower though.                         Some directory server hosts will be configured to return no more than         a preset number of entries. If this occurs, the server will indicate         that it has only returned a partial results set. This also occurs if         you use this parameter to limit the count of fetched entries.                                        timelimit                      Sets the number of seconds how long is spend on the search. Setting        this to 0 means no limit.              Note:                  This parameter can NOT override server-side preset timelimit. You can         set it lower though.                                        deref                      Specifies how aliases should be handled during the search.

LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING - aliases should be           dereferenced during the search but not when locating the base object           of the search.                                                 LDAP_DEREF_FINDING - aliases should be           dereferenced when locating the base object but not during the search.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a    (persistent) link that&#039;s already open with the same host,    username and password.  If one is found, an identifier for it    will be returned instead of opening a new connection.          Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when    the execution of the script ends.  Instead, the link will remain    open for future use (mysql_close() will not    close links established by mysql_pconnect()).          This type of link is therefore called &#039;persistent&#039;.            Parameters                    server                      The MySQL server. It can also include a port number. e.g.         \"hostname:port\" or a path to a local socket e.g. \":/path/to/socket\" for         the localhost.                      If the PHP directive         mysql.default_host is undefined (default), then the default         value is &#039;localhost:3306&#039;                                username                      The username. Default value is the name of the user that owns the        server process.                                password                      The password. Default value is an empty password.                                client_flags                      The client_flags parameter can be a combination         of the following constants:        128 (enable LOAD DATA LOCAL handling),        MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL,         MYSQL_CLIENT_COMPRESS,         MYSQL_CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE or        MYSQL_CLIENT_INTERACTIVE.

Notes   Note:          Note, that these kind of links only work if you are using     a module version of PHP. See the     Persistent     Database Connections section for more information.          Warning         Using persistent connections can require a bit of tuning of your Apache     and MySQL configurations to ensure that you do not exceed the number of     connections allowed by MySQL.          Note:          You can suppress the error message on failure by prepending      a @     to the function name.

Description       resource mysql_unbuffered_query     ( string $query    [, resource $link_identifier   ] )        mysql_unbuffered_query() sends the SQL query    query to MySQL without automatically    fetching and buffering the result rows as    mysql_query() does.  This saves a considerable    amount of memory with SQL queries that produce large result sets,    and you can start working on the result set immediately after the    first row has been retrieved as you don&#039;t have to wait until the    complete SQL query has been performed.  To use    mysql_unbuffered_query() while multiple database    connections are open, you must specify the optional parameter    link_identifier to identify which connection    you want to use.            Parameters                    query                      The SQL query to execute.

If the link identifier is not specified, the last link opened by mysql_connect() is assumed. If no such link is found, it will try to create one as if mysql_connect() was called with no arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error is generated.                    Return Values       For SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE or EXPLAIN statements,    mysql_unbuffered_query()     returns a resource on success, or FALSE on    error.          For other type of SQL statements, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc,    mysql_unbuffered_query() returns TRUE on success    or FALSE on error.            Notes   Note:          The benefits of mysql_unbuffered_query() come     at a cost: you cannot use mysql_num_rows() and     mysql_data_seek() on a result set returned from     mysql_unbuffered_query(), until all rows are fetched.     You also have to fetch all result rows from an unbuffered SQL query     before you can send a new SQL query to MySQL, using the same     link_identifier.

This attempts to push current output all the way to    the browser with a few caveats.          flush() may not be able to override the buffering scheme    of your web server and it has no effect on any client-side buffering in the    browser.  It also doesn&#039;t affect PHP&#039;s userspace output buffering mechanism.    This means you will have to call both ob_flush() and    flush() to flush the ob output buffers if you are using    those.          Several servers, especially on Win32, will still buffer the output from    your script until it terminates before transmitting the results to the    browser.          Server modules for Apache like mod_gzip may do buffering of their own that    will cause flush() to not result in data being sent    immediately to the client.          Even the browser may buffer its input before displaying it. Netscape, for    example, buffers text until it receives an end-of-line or the beginning of    a tag, and it won&#039;t render tables until the </table> tag of the    outermost table is seen.          Some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer will only start to display    the page after they have received 256 bytes of output, so you may need to    send extra whitespace before flushing to get those browsers to display the    page.

When compiled with UTF-8 support, sqlite handles encoding and decoding    of UTF-8 multi-byte character sequences, but does not yet do a complete    job when working with the data (no normalization is performed for    example), and some comparison operations may still not be carried out    correctly.      Warning         It is not recommended that you use PHP in a web-server configuration     with a version of the SQLite library compiled with UTF-8 support, since     libsqlite will abort the process if it detects a problem with the     UTF-8 encoding.

For information about the meaning of the parameters, read the    sqlite_open() manual page.          sqlite_popen() will first check to see if a persistent    handle has already been opened for the given    filename.  If it finds one, it returns that handle    to your script, otherwise it opens a fresh handle to the database.

Note:          If you use persistent handles and have the database updated by a     background process (perhaps via a crontab), and that process re-creates     the database by overwriting it (either by unlinking and rebuilding, or     moving the updated version to replace the current version),     you may experience undefined behaviour when a persistent handle on the     old version of the database is recycled.

For queries that return rows, the result handle can then be used with    functions such as sqlite_fetch_array() and    sqlite_seek().          Regardless of the query type, this function will return FALSE if the    query failed.          sqlite_query() returns a buffered, seekable result    handle.  This is useful for reasonably small queries where you need to    be able to randomly access the rows.  Buffered result handles will    allocate memory to hold the entire result and will not return until it    has been fetched.

The preferred form is the first, where the dbhandle parameter is the first parameter to the function.         Return Values       Returns a result handle or FALSE on failure.          sqlite_unbuffered_query() returns a sequential    forward-only result set that can only be used to read each row, one after    the other.

Notes   Note:     When using custom (user) filters         stream_filter_register() must be called first     in order to register the desired user filter to filtername.          Note:          Stream data is read from resources (both local and remote) in chunks,     with any unconsumed data kept in internal buffers.  When a new     filter is prepended to a stream, data in the internal buffers,     which has already been processed through other filters will     not be reprocessed through the new filter     at that time.  This differs from the behavior of     stream_filter_append().          Note:          When a filter is added for read and write, two instances of the filter     are created. stream_filter_prepend() must be called twice      with STREAM_FILTER_READ and      STREAM_FILTER_WRITE to get both filter resources.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a    (persistent) link that&#039;s already open with the same host,    username and password.  If one is found, an identifier for it    will be returned instead of opening a new connection.          Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when    the execution of the script ends.  Instead, the link will remain    open for future use (sybase_close() will not    close links established by sybase_pconnect()).          This type of links is therefore called &#039;persistent&#039;.            Parameters                    servername                      The servername argument has to be a valid servername that is defined        in the &#039;interfaces&#039; file.                                username                      Sybase user name                                password                      Password associated with username.                                charset                      Specifies the charset for the connection                                appname                      Specifies an appname for the Sybase connection.        This allow you to make separate connections in the same script to the        same database. This may come handy when you have started a transaction        in your current connection, and you need to be able to do a separate        query which cannot be performed inside this transaction.

If a    child has already exited by the time of the call (a so-called \"zombie\"    process), the function returns immediately.  Any system resources used by    the child are freed.  Please see your system&#039;s wait(2) man page for    specific details as to how wait works on your system.

Parameters                    status                      pcntl_wait() will store status information        in the status parameter which can be        evaluated using the following functions:        pcntl_wifexited(),        pcntl_wifstopped(),        pcntl_wifsignaled(),        pcntl_wexitstatus(),        pcntl_wtermsig() and        pcntl_wstopsig().                                options                      If wait3 is available on your system (mostly BSD-style systems), you can        provide the optional options parameter.  If this        parameter is not provided, wait will be used for the system call.  If        wait3 is not available, providing a value for options         will have no effect. The value of options         is the value of zero or more of the following two constants        OR&#039;ed together:                 Possible values for options                                          WNOHANG                         Return immediately if no child has exited.
